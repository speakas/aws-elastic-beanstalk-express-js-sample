# Jenkins Pipeline Explanation

The `Jenkinsfile` below defines a continuous delivery pipeline that uses a Docker container with Node.js 16 as a build environment. The pipeline is defined using the "Scripted Pipeline" DSL.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'node:16'
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install --save'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Explanation:
pipeline

The pipeline block encapsulates the entire definition of the pipeline, i.e., all the steps, configurations, and stages that define the workflow of your CI/CD process.
agent

    agent: It defines where the pipeline will run. It could be any Jenkins agent (whether it be a physical agent, virtual, Docker container, etc.)
        docker: This block tells Jenkins to use Docker to spin up a container which will be used as an agent for the pipeline.
            image 'node:16': Specifies the Docker image to be used, which is the Node.js 16 image in this case. Jenkins will pull this image from DockerHub and will instantiate a Docker container using this image as an environment for the whole pipeline.

stages

    stages: This block contains all the work that the pipeline will perform, broken down into specific stages. Each stage is meant to be a logically discrete section of the build.
        stage('Build'): This block defines a stage named "Build". Stages help to segment and label different sections of your pipeline for better visualization in the Jenkins UI.
            steps: This block defines a series of one or more steps to be executed in a stage. Each step is a single task that is meant to be carried out as part of the pipeline.
                sh 'npm install --save': This step executes a shell command within the pipeline, which in this case is npm install --save. The npm install --save command installs the dependencies defined in package.json and also updates the package.json with any new/updated information.

The pipeline defined in the Jenkinsfile specifies a process that involves a build stage. The build stage, in this context, is using a Node.js environment to run an npm install command, which fetches all necessary dependencies for your Node.js application.
